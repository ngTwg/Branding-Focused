## Publishing Steps

### 1. Login to npm

```bash
npm login
```

Enter your npm credentials when prompted.

### 2. Test the package

```bash
# Dry run to see what will be published
npm publish --dry-run
```

Review the output to ensure only necessary files are included.

### 3. Publish

```bash
# For first-time public package
npm publish --access public

# For subsequent updates
npm publish
```

### 4. Verify publication

Visit: `https://www.npmjs.com/package/antigravity-ide`

### 5. Test installation

```bash
# In a different directory

## Version Management

Update version before each publish:

```bash
# Patch (bug fixes): 3.5.5 → 3.5.6
npm version patch

# Minor (new features): 3.5.0 → 3.6.0
npm version minor

# Major (breaking changes): 3.0.0 → 4.0.0
npm version major
```

## Unpublishing (Emergency Only)

If you need to remove a version within 72 hours:

```bash
npm unpublish antigravity-ide@3.5.5
```

⚠️ **Warning**: Unpublishing is discouraged. Use deprecation instead:

```bash
npm deprecate antigravity-ide@3.5.5 "This version has issues, please upgrade"
```

## Troubleshooting

**"Package name taken"**
- The name `antigravity-ide` is yours.
- If creating a new one, try: `@dokhacgiakhoa/antigravity-ide` (scoped package)

## Post-Publish Verification

- Published date
- README preview

```bash
# Test npx (recommended way)
npx antigravity-ide

# Test global installation
npm install -g antigravity-ide
antigravity-ide --version
antigravity-ide
```

## GitHub Packages Support

This project is configured to **Dual Publish**:
1. **npm Registry**: `antigravity-ide` (Public, Unscoped)
2. **GitHub Packages**: `@Dokhacgiakhoa/antigravity-ide` (Scoped to repository owner)

### How it works
The `release.yml` workflow automatically renames the package to `@Dokhacgiakhoa/antigravity-ide` *only* during the GitHub Packages publishing step. This ensures the source code remains `antigravity-ide` for npm compatibility.

### Installing from GitHub Packages
To install the scoped version from GitHub:

1. Create a `.npmrc` file in your project:
   ```ini
   @Dokhacgiakhoa:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
   //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN
   ```

2. Install:
   ```bash
   npm install @Dokhacgiakhoa/antigravity-ide
   ```
