# Check if conductor directory exists
ls -la conductor/

# Find all track directories
ls -la conductor/tracks/

# Check for required files
ls conductor/index.md conductor/product.md conductor/tech-stack.md conductor/workflow.md conductor/tracks.md
```

## Use this skill when

- Working on check if conductor directory exists tasks or workflows
- Needing guidance, best practices, or checklists for check if conductor directory exists

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to check if conductor directory exists
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Pattern Matching

**Status markers in tracks.md:**

```
- [ ] Track Name  # Not started
- [~] Track Name  # In progress
- [x] Track Name  # Complete
```

**Task markers in plan.md:**

```
- [ ] Task description  # Pending
- [~] Task description  # In progress
- [x] Task description  # Complete
```

**Track ID pattern:**

```
<type>_<name>_<YYYYMMDD>
Example: feature_user_auth_20250115
```
